# Individual-Self-Assessment

### Self Assessment

In the first couple of weeks I played the role of triangle. I used the MEDV as the dependent variable and ran some tests on that 
to see what I could find. When Will and Nalicia wanted to focus on that I switched gears and started looking at the dataset and
focused more on crime. That is something as a parent I look into when buying a house. I did not play the square role. There were
team members who had that as a strength and they took on those roles while I focused more on the X role. I enjoyed focusing on the
technologic side of the project. Working on the crime dashboard, parsing, cleaning and extracting the usable data is what I focused
on. It was difficult to use some of the tools that we haven't worked on in a few weeks. Just getting back started took a while
but it was satisfying seeing it through to the end.

### Team Assessment

I believe the 4 of us worked very well together. We talked about our roles, the questions we want to answer for our project and how
we will work on it. The first dataset we picked did not show any usable data that could be used in the project. So after week 1
we switched gears and chose the Boston Housing Project. Just so we weren't duplicating any work and wasting valuable time. We used 
the 4 hours of class time to really discuss where we are and if we needed help we could ask for it. We stayed in communication 
through Slack and Zoom outside of class as well. Will and Nalicia worked hard on their linear regression and Will knocked it out of
the park with his dashboard. Chris did so great with creating the slideshow and the README. I worked on the crime topic and was able
to make an interactive dashboard to better show the data I got.

### Summary of Project

The Boston Housing Project was a great dataset we could work on. We knew it had usable data and regression testing we could run.
We used Linear Regression testing with different variables to find the one that worked the best and gave us the results we were 
looking for. We were able to summize that the median value of the home fluctuates depending on the other variables we used.
